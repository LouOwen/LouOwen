- 👋 Hi, I’m @LouOwen
- 👀 I’m interested in getting to grips with all things Git
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use GitHub - wish me luck!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on SAP UA projects, but have a lot of SAP Basis background.
  
    I used to be a system admin and worked in SAP translation support back in the day...
- 📫 You can reach me on Teams or e-mail.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I can also speak Dutch and play the saxophone - I can even play the *Cagney and Lacey* theme!
